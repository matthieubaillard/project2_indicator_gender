# Project2 Ironhack - Building a composite indicator on gender

### Objectives : 
* Set up a database with indicators regarding gender 
* Build a composite indicator from the data 
* Write SQL queries to explore the data 

### Content of the repository : 
* this read.md file 
* an sql file to create your database in MySQL
* csv files containing the indicators' data

### About our composite indicator : 
The objective was to include data on different areas (Healthcare and reproductive rights, Education, Economic empowerment, Womenâ€™s Leadership and Government, LGBT+ Rights...) 

#### We collected data on : 
* Health (life expectancy per gender, fertility rate, births attended by health professionals) 
* Socio-economic gender equalities (school enrollment gender parity index, gender wage gap)
* Gender representation and rights (proportion of parliament seats held by women, LGBT rights index)

Our **data sources** were the World Bank data website (https://genderdata.worldbank.org/indicators), the OECD data website (https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/gender-wage-gap.htm), and the equaldex website (https://www.equaldex.com). 

*We had a lot more data on other indicators, but the comparison and normalization of different data types (percentage, number of people, years, yes/no answers for policies...) was a big challenge. We also had to define whether an indicator was "positive" or "negative" to build our composite indicator*

**The current SQL composite indicator reflects some of the indicators but not all yet.**

#### Process for data cleaning : 
* download or scrape data
* clean to have a consistent "indicator" column and consistent country names 
* normalize the values between indicators
* combine indicators into a table 
* query the final table for country evaluation
